#Australian-Rainfall-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting whether it will rain tomorrow in Australia based on historical weather data using supervised machine learning models. The goal is to support decision-making for agriculture, logistics, and weather-dependent activities.

#Dataset Description
Source: Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology

Kaggle Link: Weather Dataset - Rattle Package

Duration: 2008 to 2017

Locations: Multiple Australian weather stations

Target Variable: RainTomorrow ‚Äî whether it will rain the next day (Yes or No)

#Key Features:
Date ‚Äî used to extract Season

Temperature, Rainfall, Wind, Humidity, Pressure ‚Äî various weather measurements

RainToday, RainTomorrow ‚Äî binary indicators for rain

#Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
Handled missing values using SimpleImputer for both numerical and categorical data.

Encoded categorical features using OrdinalEncoder.

Extracted a new feature: Season from the Date column.

Used ColumnTransformer for unified preprocessing of numerical and categorical columns.

#Machine Learning Models
Two classification pipelines were built using:

Random Forest Classifier

XGBoost Classifier

Each model was wrapped in a Pipeline with the preprocessing steps.

#Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1 Score

Confusion Matrix

#Results
